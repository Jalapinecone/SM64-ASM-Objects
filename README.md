# SM64-ASM-Objects
A small collection of custom MIPS ASM objects that I have put together to use in my Super Mario 64 romhacks. 
I post them here in the unlikely chance that some other romhacker happens across it and finds one of these objects useful. 

The ASM files in the initial commit were featured in Summer Mixhack 2021
